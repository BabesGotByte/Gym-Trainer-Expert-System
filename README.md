This Gym trainer expert system is to automate the generation of fitness plans and to create a convenient and easy-to-use application for fitness freaks, trying to get fit. The system is a rule-based expert system with its fitness plans generating function. It can be used in gyms and yoga centers to recommend fitness plans.<br/>
JESS is used to build the rule based expert system, along with Java GUI as an user interface.

It will initially take some inputs from the user whether he/she is interested in losing/maintaining/gaining weight and some extra information like weight, height, gender etc regarding the same. Based on the inputs the software will calculate the gym schedule for the user.

## Software Requirements

1) Java SE-9<br/>
2) Eclipse IDE and editor<br/>
3) Jess - Oracleâ€™s Jess<br/>


## Tech Stack

Jess is written entirely in Java and as a result, it is possible to run any Java code inside of it, with the exception of defining new classes. Swing is used to create the user ineterface.
